\chapter{Conclusion}

\yerotherpblack has a \thickclient
software--system architecture because we
found \thickclient software--system
architectures simpler than \webbrowserbased
software--system architectures.

A \webbrowserbased software--system
architecture has more drawbacks as
follows:

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
	\item it requires at least $3$ co--related 
		software--systems are required 
		(e.g.: DBMS, web server, application server.)
		to fully operate.
		
	\item A \webbrowserbased software--system
		requires at least $4$ layers within
		its logical system architecture
		(e.g.: client, presentation, logic, and data).

	\item A \webbrowserbased software--system
		potentially possesses more software
		security vulnerabilities because its
		implementation requires of the use of
		at least $2$ different programming 
		languages, and frameworks in combination.
\end{enumerate}

Table~\ref{tab:thickclient-application-againts-webbrowserbased-application}
demonstrates \thickclient software--system architecture
is better than \webbrowserbased software--systems.
