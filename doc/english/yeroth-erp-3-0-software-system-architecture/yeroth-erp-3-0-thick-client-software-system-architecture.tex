\section{Business and user interface code deployment}

Table~\ref{tab:thickclient-application-againts-webbrowserbased-application}
depicts the issue of business and user
interface code deployment on all computers
participating in the functioning of \yerotherpblack,
as a software--system for a user.

We tackle the problem of automatic deployment of
business and user interface code on all user
computers by using the '\texttt{apt upgrade}'
software--system on '\debianlinux'.


\section{Sample technical configurations}

This section illustrates $2$ different possible
technical computer network configurations that
could prevail in the industry.
