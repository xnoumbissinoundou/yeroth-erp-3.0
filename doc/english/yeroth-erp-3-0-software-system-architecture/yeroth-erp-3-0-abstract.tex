This document describes the \thickclient
software--system architecture of \yerotherpblack.
This document also explains the reasons for
which we chose to design and implement
\yerotherpblack as a \thickclient software--system,
as opposed to currently more popular
\webbrowserbased software--system.

\textcolor{purplish}{
This document futher demonstrates the superiority,
in terms of simplicity, speed, maintainance, and
low costs of development of \thickclient
software--system architectures over \webbrowserbased
software--system architectures !}
