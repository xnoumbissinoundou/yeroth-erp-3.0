\chapter{Conclusion}

\yerotherpblack has a \thickclient
software--system architecture because we
found \thickclient software--system
architectures simpler than \webbrowserbased
software--system architectures.

Thick--client software--system architecture because it
requires less layers in its logical
software--syste architecture.

Table~\ref{tab:thickclient-application-againts-webbrowserbased-application}
illustrates a \thickclient software--system
requires less layers in its logical
software--system architecture than a
\webbrowserbased software--system.

a \webbrowserbased software--system
potentially entails more present
software security vulnerabilities 
because its implementation requires
to use at least $2$ different programming
languages, and frameworks in combination.

A \webbrowserbased software--system
architecture has more drawbacks as
follows:

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
	\item it requires at least $3$ other 
		software applications to fully operate
		(e.g.: DBMS, web server, application server.).
		
	\item A \webbrowserbased software--system
		requires at least $4$ layers in
		its logical system architecture
		(e.g.: client, presentation, logic,
		and data layers).

	\item A \webbrowserbased software--system
		potentially possesses more software
		security vulnerabilities because its
		implementation requires to use at least
		$2$ different programming languages, and
		frameworks in combination.
\end{enumerate}
