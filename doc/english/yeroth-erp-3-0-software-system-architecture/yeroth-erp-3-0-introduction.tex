\section{Motivation}
\index{motivation for creating \yerotherpblack}

\yerotherpblack is an \textbf{Enterprise Resource Planing (ERP)}
software--system that aims 'effectiveness' and 'simplicity',
compared to other high ranked ERP software--systems
(e.g.: \sageerp, \saperp, etc.).

We chose to design and implement \yerotherpblack as
a \thickclient software--system because of the
following reasons:

\begin{enumerate}[1.]

	\item the implementation language \cplusplus
		offers much flexibility:
		
		\begin{enumerate}[1.]
			\item \emph{MULTIPLE INHERITENCE:}
			
			It allows developers to abstract as much as possible
			business code upwards, away from downwards implementation
			classes. For instance,  in \yerotherpblack,
			GUI--Qt-windows inherits for instance
			\emph{search filtering feature, and print capability
			from $2$ different classes}.

			\emph{Print capability couldn't be inherited from the
			same class where search filtering is abstracted and
			partially implemented (interface in \Java for instance
			doesn't allow any method body code), because it works
			in its pure abstract class (\cplusplus class with at
			least $1$ empty method body) together with feature
			\textbf{database column filtering for printing.}}
			\newline
			
			\emph{\yerothrouge{The drawback of the multiple inheritance
			in \cplusplus is it sometimes can be very
			difficult to build it using "\gplusplus~\cite{gcc:2020}" !}}
		
			\item \emph{MACROS:}
		\end{enumerate}						
		
	\item the availability of \texttt{'WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET'}
		(\wy) tools for fast and useful
		user interface design (e.g.: \qtdesigner~\cite{qtdesigner:2020},
		\ministudio~\cite{miniStudio:2020}, etc.)
		
	\item the low number of logical software architecture
		layer ($2$) involved with the operation
		of a \thickclient software--system,	as opposed
		to a \webbrowserbased software--system
		(with at least a $4$ layers in its 
		logical software architecture ).
	
\end{enumerate}
