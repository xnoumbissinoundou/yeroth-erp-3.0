\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

\yerotherpblack is an \textbf{Enterprise Resource Planing (ERP)}
software--system that aims 'effectiveness' and 'simplicity',
compared to other high ranked ERP software--systems
(e.g.: \sageerp, \saperp, etc.).

We chose to design and implement \yerotherpblack as
a \thickclient software--system because of the
following reasons:

\begin{enumerate}[1)]

	\item the implementation language \cplusplus
		offers much flexibility (use of macro, 
		multiple inheritance, etc.)
		
	\item the availability of \texttt{'WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET'}
		(\wy) tools for fast and useful
		user interface design (e.g.: \qtdesigner~\cite{qtdesigner:2020},
		\ministudio~\cite{miniStudio:2020}, etc.)
		
	\item the low number of logical software architecture
		layer ($2$) involved with the operation
		of a \thickclient software--system,	as opposed
		to a \webbrowserbased software--system
		(with at least a $4$ layers in its 
		logical software architecture ).
	
\end{enumerate}
