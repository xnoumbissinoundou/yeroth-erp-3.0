This introduction motivates why I created \yerotherpblack,
and why it uses the best software programming language
of its time !

\section{Motivation}
\index{motivation for creating \yerotherpblack}

\yerotherpblack is an \textbf{Enterprise Resource Planing (ERP)}
software--system that aims 'effectiveness' and 'simplicity',
compared to other high ranked ERP software--systems
(e.g.: \sageerp, \saperp, etc.).

We chose to design and implement \yerotherpblack as
a \thickclient software--system because of the
following reasons:

\begin{enumerate}[1.]

	\item The implementation language \cplusplus
		offers much flexibility:
		
		\begin{enumerate}[1.]
			\item \emph{\yerothvert{MULTIPLE INHERITANCE:}}
			
			It allows developers to abstract as much as possible
			business code upwards, away from downwards implementation
			classes. For instance,  in \yerotherpblack,
			GUI--Qt--windows inherits for instance
			\emph{search filtering feature, and print capability
			from $2$ different classes}.

			\emph{\textbf{Print capability} couldn't be inherited from the
			same class where search filtering is abstracted and
			partially implemented (interface in \Java for instance
			doesn't allow any method body code), because it works
			in its pure abstract class (\cplusplus class with at
			least $1$ empty method body), together with feature
			\textbf{database column filtering for viewing and printing.}}
			\newline
			
			\emph{\yerothrouge{The drawback of the multiple inheritance
			in \cplusplus is: it sometimes can be very
			difficult to build it using "\gplusplus~\cite{gcc:2020}" !}}
			\newline
		
			\item \emph{\yerothvert{MACROS:}}

			They enable developers to create TEXT TEMPLATE in their code.	
					
			For instance, I use macros in some parts of my code
			to increase execution time, and reduce stack activation for
			method or function calls in \yerotherpblack\ !						
			\newline
						
		\end{enumerate}						
		
	\item The availability of \texttt{'WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET'}
		(\wy) tools for fast and useful
		user interface design (e.g.: \qtdesigner~\cite{qtdesigner:2020},
		\ministudio~\cite{miniStudio:2020}, etc.)
		
	\item The low number of logical software--system architecture
		layer (i.e.: $2$.) involved with the use
		of a \thickclient software--system architecture, as
		opposed to a \webbrowserbased software--system (i.e.: $4$,
		\emph{client user interface}, \emph{presentation layer},
		\emph{business logic}, and \emph{data (DBMS)}).
	
\end{enumerate}
